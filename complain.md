## Subject: Urgent Request Regarding Operating System Exam (Paper Code: 2877) - Maintaining Anonymity

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention a sensitive matter concerning the Operating System Exam (Paper Code: 2877) held on 26th July 2023 in Room No. 302.

It has come to our attention that certain irregularities occurred during the conduct of the exam, impacting the fairness and integrity of the assessment. The exam was scheduled to begin at 08:00 AM; however, the question paper was distributed five minutes late, at 08:05 AM. This reduced the already limited duration available to complete the paper.

Furthermore, the exam materials, including the OMR sheets and question papers, were collected by the examiner at 09:15 AM, well before the designated end time of 09:30 AM. This premature collection caused distress among the students, leading to rushed attempts at filling the OMR sheets and potentially compromising the accuracy of their responses.

As concerned students, we believe it is vital to maintain the sanctity of the examination process and uphold the principles of fairness and impartiality. We kindly request that a thorough investigation be conducted into the incident. We also urge that the identities of the students involved in this complaint remain confidential, as they fear any repercussions for speaking out.

In light of these circumstances, we suggest the following measures:

1. An impartial investigation into the reported irregularities during the examination.
2. Consideration of potential remedies for the affected students, such as a retest or appropriate adjustments in the grading process.
3. Implementing measures to prevent similar incidents in future examinations.

We trust that you will take this matter seriously and treat it with the utmost confidentiality. Resolving this issue will not only restore faith in the examination system but also reinforce the reputation of our esteemed institution as one that upholds fairness and transparency.

We earnestly hope for a prompt and unbiased resolution to this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this sensitive issue.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
