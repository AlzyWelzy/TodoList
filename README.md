# Todo App with Streamlit

This is a simple Todo App built using Streamlit. The app allows you to manage your tasks and increase your productivity. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

- **Mark Todos as Completed:** You can mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox next to it. The completed tasks will be crossed out for easy identification.

- **Delete Completed Todos:** If you no longer need a completed task, you can click the checkbox again to unmark it, and then click the "Delete" button to remove it from your list.
