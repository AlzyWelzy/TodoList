Hey OP,

I'm glad you interested in making investment choices,

I would suggest you watch some articles on investing in long term, I wouldn't suggest short term yet as I belive you would be interested in pursuing courses etc,

!!!Though please note no investment is risk free!!!

If this money is part of your life that you can't lose, an fd is the safest option.

Anyways don't worry you got your whole life ahead to earn and make your name, if you have in excess you can diversify your portfolio.

All the best with your career choices and sorry but degrees do matter no matter what elon musk says üëç

Though it has absolutely no time or fundamental value, a degrees intrinsic value keeps increasing also it opens way more doors [:joy:]

To learn how to to trade, My friend all the information of the world is at your fingertips start reading üìö [:slightly_smiling:]

All the best [:thumbs_up:]

Hello,

Sharing some basics for investing:

Set your goals: Before investing, it's important to determine your financial goals. What are you investing for? Are you trying to save for a big purchase (a few years away), retirement (decades away), etc.? To learn some of the basics of personal finance you could start with these books:

Let's talk Money by Monika Halan

Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki

Three Pigs to Financial Freedom by Rishi Piparaiya

One up on Wall Street by Peter Lunch

Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about different investment options and how they work. There are a variety of investment vehicles available, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Learn from experienced tutors whether online or offline.

Start small: It's not necessary to invest a large sum of money right away. Start with a small amount that you're comfortable with and increase your investments over time. Once you have established a solid budget and are on your way to paying off debt, you should consider investing earlier rather than later in order to take advantage of compound interest. Saving and investing are broader topics and what you invest in depends on your risk tolerance.

Here are a few more books that introduce you to some of those concepts.

Common Sense on Mutual Funds by John C. Bogle

Indian Mutual Funds Handbook by Sundar Sankaran

Market Wizards by Jack Schwager

The psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

The little book that still beats the market by Joel Greenblatt

Choose an investment account: Consider opening a broking account or paper trading. Many online brokers offer low-cost investment options and allow you to buy and sell investments online.

Diversify your portfolio: Diversification is key to reducing risk in your investment portfolio. This means investing in a variety of different types of investments, rather than putting all your money into one stock or fund.

Stay the course: Investing is a long-term strategy. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations and focus on your long-term financial goals.

Remember, investing involves risk and it's important to do your research and consult before making any investment decisions.

P.S: Sharing a list of few more books for your reference. Hope it helps:

Beating The Street By Peter Lynch

///////////////////////////////////

Fundamental analysis: 1. Read one up wall street and beating the street by Peter Lynch 2. Read five rules by pat Dorsey 3. By now you should have understood how fundamental analysis works and also how to read/interpret financial statements 4. Watch how analysis are done in various business on YouTube by channels like soic, value educator and scientific investing. They do very high quality fundamental analysis. You will slowly learn the kind of patterns and how to apply them. People complain about videos being long, but if you think they are long. You haven't understood fundamental analysis because it will take you longer to learn about the business yourself. 5. Pick Random companies, look at how they have performed over the years through financial statements, stock prices, etc. Basically apply everything you have learnt so far. It might seem very long. But, if you don't want to put so much effort. Index funds and mutual funds are always there :)

//////////////////////////////////////////

Just watch 2 YouTube channels 1)power of stocks 2)art of trading they have playlists for basic also.

Start to accumulate basic knowledge about Indian stock market. Through videos or Books.

Beware of unsolicited fraud through telegram, whatsapp group and other sources.

Try listening cnbc awaaz or zee business for some knowledge.

I recommend TRADING VEIW which I use to analyze the market.

Try screener.in to analyze any particular stocks fundamentals. Before buying or selling.

LEARN chart pattern, Technical indicators , startegy. Through books or videos.

And Most inportant Thing- Don't do stocks market as hobby If you do that it will cost you money ( Because Hobby costs Money) Treat it like business and you may find yourself Successful.

And just be consistent

That's awesome! Reminds me of my college lol.

Well, 1. You can't trade stocks beyond 1d, 2. Unless you have the stomach to take a huge loss, you won't take 1 cuz it's at times too much risk. (I had shorted tatasteel once cuz I was pretty confident about a combination of factors, ideally that stock shouldn't have moved more than 0.5% from my short, but fml it hit a goddamn 3-4% or something, I remember losing ~1L on it.

So, you can 1. Invest, 2. Trade. You can't trade stocks beyond 1d cuz you won't have the margin.

So! Crypto will have a different story (it's what you can trade apart from us stocks), you start with this.

    Find out what money is, what fiat currency is, how it's regulated, how different countries have their own currency, importance of the dollar

    Understand about how a company operates, what is capital? What are profits and revenues, who are the stakeholders, what/who are promoters, AND most importantly, what is perceived value? Why is Zomato which was always making losses, listed soo high? How do people evaluate a company? Doing this you should also be able to read company balance sheets and quarterly results.

    Learn how this is represented in the trading terminal (the screen where you trade), what are candle sticks, whats L1/L2/L3 market? What is bearish? When are bears aggressive?

    Think about both perceived value and what people could be thinking later, can you predict what people think later? Cuz a stock price is the weighted average price given to it by all participating investors/traders. At this point you'll realize how support and resistance work, why every single candle pattern pattern is.

    With this, you start analyzing based on history cuz people don't change a lot. Now you could trade, you could swing trade (only if you have a lot of cap), or you can invest.

Btw, most important thing is, you gotta be able to stomach the losses. Don't trade cash that is needed, maybe safely invest it. I still remember I started off with ~18k, made 30k on a bull market by taking huge risks and one day out if no where I lost 28k. Now I make more than that each day (apart from trading, never ever tell yourself your trading income is stable income) but back when I lost this, it was 2 months of income :'/
