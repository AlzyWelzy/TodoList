I am filing a formal complaint regarding the SBI SimplySAVE credit card issue When I applied I was promised a Lifetime Free LTF card with no Joining Fees or Annual Maintenance Charges AMC However upon receiving the card there was no mention of its LTF status and an email notified me of the need to pay Joining Fees and AMC Despite seeking clarification from customer care I received no satisfactory response Consequently I decided against activating the card to avoid further issues but I fear non payment of the disputed fees may negatively impact my credit score I demand a reissued SimplySAVE card as LTF without any Joining Fees or AMC along with compensation for potential credit score damage caused by misleading information I urgently request the Banking Ombudsman intervention for a fair resolution Relevant documentation has been provided for review
